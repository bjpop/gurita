# Hatch: a command line plotting and analytics tool

Hatch is a command line tool for analysing and visualising data taking input from tabular data in CSV or TSV format.

At its core, Hatch provides a suite of commands, each of which carries out a common data analytics or plotting task.
Additionally, Hatch allows commands to be chained together into flexible analysis pipelines.

It is designed to be fast and convenient, and is particularly suited to data exploration tasks. Input files with large numbers of rows (> millions) are readily supported.

Hatch commands are highly customisable, however sensible defaults are applied. Therefore simple tasks are easy to express
and complex tasks are possible.

Hatch is implemented in [Python](http://www.python.org/) and makes extensive use of the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/>), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/>), and [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) libraries for data processing and plot generation.
