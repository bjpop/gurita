# Hatch: a command line plotting and analytics tool

Hatch is a command line tool for analysing and visualising data.

It takes input from tabular data in CSV or TSV format and produces high-quality plots (charts, graphs) as output.

It is designed to be fast and convenient, and is particularly suited to data exploration tasks. Input files with large numbers of rows (> millions) are readily supported.

Hatch plots are highly customisable, however for most cases sensible defaults are applied.

Hatch is implemented in [Python](http://www.python.org/) and makes extensive use of the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/>), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/>), and [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) libraries for data processing and plot generation.
